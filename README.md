# WIFF-Model
 Wave-induced Floe Fracture Code

This is code for WIFF1.0 - An accelerated superparameterized wave-induced floe fracture code. 

This was developed by Chris Horvat and Lettie Roach. 

The code consists of several subfolders and code in MATLAB and Python. It references data that is not  included in this repository but is located in a Zenodo repository referenced here: XX AVAILABLE ON PUBLICATION XX. 

The code is structured as follows:
